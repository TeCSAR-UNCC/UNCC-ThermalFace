# UNCC-ThermalFace

This repository is a public dataset of facial thermal images “Charlotte”, which is available to the scientific community for research purposes. The dataset was collected by researchers at UNC Charlotte. As Figure A shows through some sample images, our dataset includes thermal images of the same subjects in various thermal and physical conditions, including the environmental temperature, distance from the camera, and head positions.

We have captured approximately 10,000 infrared thermal images from 10 subjects in varying thermal conditions, at several distances from the camera, and at changing head positions. We have also controlled the air temperature to change from 20.5°C ( 69°F) to 26.5 °C( 80°F).  Images are available in four different temperatures, 10 relative distances from the camera, starting at 1m ( 3.3 ft) to 6.6m( 21.6 ft), and 25 head positions.

• The first public facial thermal dataset annotated with the environmental properties including air temperature, relative humidity, airspeed, distance from the camera, and subjective thermal sensation of each person at the time.

• All the images are manually annotated with 72 or 43 facial landmarks.

• We are publishing the data in the original 16-bit radiometric TemperatureLinear format, which has the thermal value of each pixel.

Figure B. displays the (a)temperature and (b)relative humidity coverage based on the number of images for each range. The temperature range is between 20.6 °C and 26.6 °C, divided into four groups with a 1.5 °C range for each. This figure shows an approximately uniform distribution in the room (a)air temperature, which means the number of data frames in different temperature ranges is approximately the same. Although we have not controlled the (b)relative humidity in the recording process, controlling the air temperature has resulted in changes in relative humidity, which were recorded and added to the annotations. Additional statistical information about the environmental properties, including air temperature, globe temperature, relative humidity, and airflow, is provided in Table A. Most of the sessions
had zero airflows to ensure image consistency; however, the air conditioner was at 0.5 m/s airspeed at the diffuser proximity in extremely cold conditions.
